# Inter-Repository Merge Script (IRM-Script)

**IRM-Script can be used to clone and merge git repositories with different remote origin addresses in isolated networks.** These repositories could be placed in different networks such as the internet and the corporate intranet and can be isolated in any way.

For the download (cloning) step, IRM-Script clone defined git repositories from remote git address (source address). 

For the upload step, IRM-Script upload cloned repositories to defined git address (destination address) with new branch names formatted as IRM-SCRIPT-CODEMERGE-date.

Source and destination Git repository addresses are defined in the configuration files (repository.config, repository.list.config). 

**IRM-Script can clone and merge any number of repositories at once.**

IRM-Script can support merge operation for "develop" branches between source and destination Git repositories. If any conflicts occur, IRM-Script informs the user and logs Git conflict outputs to the associated log file.

The user can check and watch all processes from the prompt screen and also from the log.txt file. All prompt screen output logged to this file.
